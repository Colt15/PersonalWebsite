            <h2>Some History</h2><br>
            <h4>Computers have always been a fascination of mine. I got my first computer around 8 years of age, and over the years I started causing and solving a multitude of technical problems. Solving these problems was rewarding, but I never was sure about turning my favorite hobby into a career.</h4><br>
            <p>However, I found that I experienced that same rewarding feeling whenever I solved a programming issue I was having. My father was lucky enough to find a job that he loved doing, and I can only hope that programming gives me the same treatment.</p>

            <h2>Setting Goals</h2><br>
            <h4><strong>CURRENT GOAL:</strong> To complete my studies at Coder Foundry, and use the training acquired therein to find gainful employment.</h4><br>
            <p>
                <strong>TO THE FUTURE:</strong> In addition to employment, I also want to learn new languages, both programming and lingual. Knowing more in both of those fields will only make me more qualified and attractive to prospective employers.
